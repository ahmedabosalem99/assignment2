        <h1 id ="C2">Skills</h1>
        <h2>HTML/CSS skills</h2>
        <p>If you hope to become a web developer, you must understand HTML and CSS. HTML is the most used markup language across the web, and web developers use it to create web pages on the Internet. CSS, on the other hand, is used to style the website. It's responsible for the choice of fonts, colors and layout in a website's design. Whereas HTML lays the foundation for a webpage, CSS styles it.</p>
        <h2>Analytical skills</h2>
        <p>As a web developer, you'll need to have keen analytical skills to create a variety of successful websites. This involves ensuring the coding is correct so the website is functional. Also, it's important to understand the needs of your customers or clients. You'll need to analyze their wants and needs and be ready to adapt to any changes they'd like to see implemented on the website. The better you understand your client, the better your website will turn out for them in the end.</p>
        <h2>Responsive design skills</h2>
        <p>If you work as a web developer, it's important to understand how responsive design works. Because many people view webpages both online and on their mobile devices, the websites you create need to adapt to the changing screen sizes. If your website isn't responsive, this means it won't be compatible with either the desktop site or the mobile site. In other words, it won't function or show up properly on either of these platforms. Your ability to create a responsive design can also impact the number of visitors a website gets since most people are deterred from a website when it's not displaying properly.</p>
        <h2>JavaScript skills </h2>
        <p>You'll also need to understand JavaScript as a web developer. JavaScript is a high-level programming language that implements complex features onto a website. This involves things like moving elements, search bars, videos or interactive maps on a webpage. In knowing JavaScript, you'll be able to meet higher expectations from your clients in the web development process. Using these skills, you'll be able to reel in more webpage viewers, as well, since the majority of people tend to prefer interactive web pages that grab their attention. Special features go a long way in engaging viewers, and your job as a web developer plays a large role in seeing them come to fruition on a digital screen.</p>
